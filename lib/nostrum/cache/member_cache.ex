  Cache behaviour & dispatcher for guild members.

  You can call the functions provided by this module independent of which cache
  is configured, and it will dispatch to the configured cache implementation.

  By default, #{@default_cache_implementation} will be used for caching
  members. You can override this in the `:caches` option of the `:nostrum`
  application by setting the `:members` field to a different module
  implementing the behaviour defined by this module.

  The user-facing functions of this module can be called with a custom cache as
  the final argument. This is mainly useful if you want to test the cache: by
  default, nostrum will use #{@default_cache_implementation}.

  Even if the required intents to receive `GUILD_MEMBER_UPDATE` events are
  disabled to a point where we do not receive guild creation events, it is
  still possible to receive the event for our own user. An example of this can
  be found in [issue
  #293](https://github.com/Kraigie/nostrum/issues/293). Note that the issue
  predates the modern nostrum caching infrastructure.

  Return a QLC query handle for cache read operations.

  This is used by nostrum to provide any read operations on the cache. Write

  The Erlang manual on [Implementing a QLC
  Table](https://www.erlang.org/doc/man/qlc.html#implementing_a_qlc_table)
  contains examples for implementation. To prevent full table scans, accept
  match specifications in your `TraverseFun` and implement a `LookupFun` as
  documented.

  The query handle must return items in the form `{guild_id, user_id,
  member}`, where:
  - `guild_id` is a `t:Nostrum.Struct.Guild.id/0`,
  - `user_id` is a `t:Nostrum.Struct.User.id/0`, and
  - `member` is a `t:Nostrum.Struct.Guild.Member.t/0`.

  If your cache needs some form of setup or teardown for QLC queries (such as
  opening connections), see `c:wrap_qlc/1`.

  will then effectively call `wrap_qlc(fn -> :qlc.e(...) end)`.
